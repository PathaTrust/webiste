                A pioneering initiative dedicated to
                bridging the gap between underprivileged individuals and
                compassionate individuals like you willing to support them. At
                PATHA, we believe in creating better opportunities and
                pathways for marginalised communities, especially children
                facing socio-economic challenges. With a deep understanding of
                societal needs and a passion for social impact, Ms. Jeevitha B
                Kong envisioned PATHA as a catalyst for positive change.
                Backed by a team of compassionate individuals and strategic
                partners, we are here to make a meaningful difference in the
                lives of those in need.

              <p class="short-text">
                From a young age, I found myself drawn to social development and volunteering. It began during my school
                days, where every bit of my free time was devoted to helping others. Over the years, I immersed myself
                deeply in the world of service, volunteering with more than ten NGOs across the country. My friends and
                acquaintances often came to me, asking for recommendations of children’s homes or orphanages where they
                could celebrate events like birthdays or anniversaries. These gestures, while generous, only scratched
                the surface of what I felt needed to be done.
              </p>
              <p class="additional-text d-none">
                In 2023, while pursuing my engineering studies, a moment came that would change everything. A classmate
                of mine approached me with a story that deeply moved me. It was about a girl named Basamma, a
                20-year-old living in a village in Gulbarga, the same age as I was, yet burdened with challenges I could
                hardly imagine. Her youngest brother, Ashok, was 12 years old and 90% mentally challenged, entirely
                dependent on her for care. Basamma, despite being a dedicated and studious girl, was on the verge of
                giving up her dream of becoming a government teacher. She simply couldn’t juggle her responsibilities
                for Ashok while pursuing her own education.

                Understanding the weight of her struggles, I knew I had to help. The first step was finding a care
                center for Ashok, somewhere that could meet his needs, allowing Basamma the freedom to continue her
                studies. I thought it would be a simple matter of finding the right organization, but I quickly learned
                how difficult it was to find a place willing to take in someone like Ashok, who needed extensive care.
                Phone call after phone call, I was rejected by organizations, most of whom cited the overwhelming
                responsibility of caring for a child so dependent that he couldn’t even feed himself without help.

                After countless rejections, a close volunteer friend stepped in to assist. We managed to find a center
                in Kolar that agreed to take Ashok in. Relief washed over me, but it was short-lived. Less than two
                weeks later, I received a call from the center. They told me Ashok’s needs were too great for them to
                handle and that I needed to take him back. Heartbroken but determined, I kept searching, eventually
                finding Home of Hope, a shelter run by Auto Raja. Finally, Ashok had a place where he could stay and
                receive the care he needed.

                This experience with one family opened my eyes to a harsh reality. The divide between those with access
                to help and those without seemed impossibly vast. It left me wondering how many others across the state
                were enduring similar or even worse circumstances. Who was helping them? How many people out there, like
                Basamma, lacked the resources, the knowledge, or simply the connections to find a solution?

                Even with all the support I had around me—friends, contacts in NGOs, and a passion to help—it had taken
                so much time and effort just to find one child a home. There are millions of NGOs in this country, many
                of them working hard to serve communities in need, but I couldn’t help but wonder if they were truly
                reaching the people who needed them most. That’s when the idea took root.

                I realized that if I were to ever create something, it would be a platform that bridges this gap—a space
                where people in need could connect with the right NGOs, and where NGOs could find the beneficiaries they
                had set out to serve. It would be a network of compassion, ensuring that no one like Basamma or Ashok
                would have to struggle alone.

                Through this platform, individuals in need can avail themselves of information
                regarding available opportunities, while organizations can identify suitable
                beneficiaries to extend their support
